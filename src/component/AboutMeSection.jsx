                    </h2>
                    <p className="leading-relaxed text-lg">
                        I started out by jumping headfirst into **React**, and honestly, I was hooked immediately! The idea of building a dynamic, component-based user interface just clicked for me. From there, I've been mastering modern JavaScript, learning how to connect the pieces and make things actually work seamlessly.

                        What Drives Me:
                    </h2>
                    <p className="leading-relaxed text-lg">
                        I really enjoy the **front-end puzzle**. Specifically, I love figuring out the best ways to structure components using **functional programming principles**, wrestling with **CSS-in-JS solutions** or Tailwind's utility classes to nail a pixel-perfect design, and, most of all, optimizing rendering performance so the user experience is super smooth.

                        When I'm Not Coding:
                    </h2>
                    <p className="leading-relaxed text-lg">
                        When I need a screen break, you can usually find me **exploring nature trails** or **experimenting with a new recipe**. There's something therapeutic about following a process and creating something beautiful or delicious. It's surprisingly similar to debuggingâ€”a little patience and precision goes a long way!
